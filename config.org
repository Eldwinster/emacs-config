** Better defaults
*** Simple settings

Browsing the web and seeing [[https://github.com/angrybacon/dotemacs/blob/master/dotemacs.org#use-better-defaults][angrybacon/dotemacs]] and comparing with the values
shown by =SPC h v= and selecting what I thought looks good, I've ended up adding
the following:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default
 delete-by-moving-to-trash t                      ; Delete files to trash
 window-combination-resize t                      ; take new window space from all other windows (not just current)
 x-stretch-cursor t)                              ; Stretch cursor to the glyph width

(setq undo-limit 80000000                         ; Raise undo-limit to 80Mb
      evil-want-fine-undo t                       ; By default while in insert all changes are one big blob. Be more granular
      auto-save-default t                         ; Nobody likes to loose work, I certainly don't
      truncate-string-ellipsis "…"                ; Unicode ellispis are nicer than "...", and also save /precious/ space
      password-cache-expiry nil                   ; I can trust my computers ... can't I?
      ;; scroll-preserve-screen-position 'always     ; Don't have `point' jump around
      scroll-margin 2)                            ; It's nice to maintain a little margin

(display-time-mode 1)                             ; Enable time in the mode-line

(unless (string-match-p "^Power N/A" (battery))   ; On laptops...
  (display-battery-mode 1))                       ; it's nice to know how much power you have

(global-subword-mode 1)                           ; Iterate through CamelCase words
#+end_src

*** Auto-customisations

By default changes made via a customisation interface are added to =init.el=.
I prefer the idea of using a separate file for this. We just need to change a
setting, and load it if it exists.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default custom-file (expand-file-name ".custom.el" doom-private-dir))
(when (file-exists-p custom-file)
  (load custom-file))
#+end_src

*** Windows

I find it rather handy to be asked which buffer I want to see after splitting
the window. Let's make that happen.

First, we'll enter the new window
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq evil-vsplit-window-right t
      evil-split-window-below t)
#+end_src

Then, we'll pull up a buffer prompt.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! prompt-for-buffer (&rest _)
  :after '(evil-window-split evil-window-vsplit)
  (consult-buffer))
#+end_src
** Doom configuration
*** Modules
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no
:END:
Doom has this lovely /modular configuration base/ that takes a lot of work out of
configuring Emacs. Each module (when enabled) can provide a list of packages to
install (on ~doom sync~) and configuration to be applied. The modules can also
have flags applied to tweak their behaviour.
#+name: init.el
#+attr_html: :collapsed t
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el" :noweb no-export :noweb-prefix no :comments no
;;; init.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; This file controls what Doom modules are enabled and what order they load in.
;; Press 'K' on a module to view its documentation, and 'gd' to browse its directory.

**** Structure
As you may have noticed by this point, this is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate]] configuration. Doom
has good support for this which we access though the ~literate~ module.

While we're in the src_elisp{:config} section, we'll use Dooms nicer defaults,
along with the bindings and smartparens behaviour (the flags aren't documented,
but they exist).

**** Interface
There's a lot that can be done to enhance Emacs' capabilities.
I reckon enabling half the modules Doom provides should do it.

*** Visual Settings
**** Font Face
'Fira Code' is nice, and 'Overpass' makes for a nice sans companion. We just need to
fiddle with the font sizes a tad so that they visually match. Just for fun I'm
trying out JetBrains Mono though. So far I have mixed feelings on it, some
aspects are nice, but on others I prefer Fira.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

In addition to these fonts, Merriweather is used with =nov.el=, and Alegreya as a
serifed proportional font used by =mixed-pitch-mode= for =writeroom-mode= with Org
files.

Because we care about how things look let's add a check to make sure we're told
if the system doesn't have any of those fonts.

This way whenever fonts are missing, after Doom's UI has initialised, a warning
listing the missing fonts should appear for at least half a second.
**** Theme, transparency and modeline
As I like pywal, I tried to find a way to use it within emacs. However, this doesn't look that good most of the time. By that I mean that I lose in lisibility so that quite inefficient way to use a theme.
That why I set a fixed theme within emacs, pywal be damned I prefer to see what I'm doing than using a shiny useless tool. I still keep the code maybe be there is a way to fix some color and while keeping the feature of wal in some aspects.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no

~doom-one~ is nice and all, but I find the ~vibrant~ variant nicer. Oh, and with the
nice selection doom provides there's no reason for me to want the defaults.

Why would you use all those beautiful wallpaper, while most of the time you won't see them.
As I like my wallpaper, I quite like transparency, so here it is.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'alpha '(85 . 80))

#+end_src

However, by default ~red~ text is used in the ~modeline~, so let's make that orange
so I don't feel like something's gone /wrong/ when editing files.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(doom-modeline-buffer-modified :foreground "orange"))
#+end_src

While we're modifying the modeline, =LF UTF-8= is the default file encoding, and
thus not worth noting in the modeline. So, let's conditionally hide it.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding ()
  "We expect the encoding to be LF UTF-8, so only show the modeline when this is not the case"
  (setq-local doom-modeline-buffer-encoding

                                 '(coding-category-undecided coding-category-utf-8))
                           (not (memq (coding-system-eol-type buffer-file-coding-system) '(1 2))))
                t)))

(add-hook 'after-change-major-mode-hook #'doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding)
#+end_src
**** Miscellaneous
Relative line numbers are fantastic for knowing how far away line numbers are,
then =ESC 12 <UP>= gets you exactly where you think.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)
#+end_src

I'd like some slightly nicer default buffer names
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-fallback-buffer-name "► Doom"
      +doom-dashboard-name "► Doom")
#+end_src
*** Some helper macros
There are a few handy macros added by doom, namely
- ~load!~ for loading external ~.el~ files relative to this one
- ~use-package!~ for configuring packages
- ~add-load-path!~ for adding directories to the ~load-path~ where ~Emacs~ looks when
  you load packages with ~require~ or ~use-package~
- ~map!~ for binding new keys
*** Allow babel execution in CLI actions
In this config I sometimes generate code to include in my config.
This works nicely, but for it to work with =doom sync= et. al. I need to make sure
that Org doesn't try to confirm that I want to allow evaluation (I do!).

Thankfully Doom supports =$DOOMDIR/cli.el= file which is sourced every time a CLI
command is run, so we can just enable evaluation by setting
~org-confirm-babel-evaluate~ to ~nil~ there.
While we're at it, we should silence ~org-babel-execute-src-block~ to
avoid polluting the output.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle cli.el :comments no

*** Window title

I'd like to have just the buffer name, then if applicable the project folder
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq frame-title-format
      '(""
        (:eval
         (if (s-contains-p org-roam-directory (or buffer-file-name ""))
             (replace-regexp-in-string
              ".*/[0-9]*-?" "☰ "
              (subst-char-in-string ?_ ?  buffer-file-name))
           "%b"))
        (:eval
         (let ((project-name (projectile-project-name)))
           (unless (string= "-" project-name)
             (format (if (buffer-modified-p)  " ◉ %s" "  ●  %s") project-name))))))
#+end_src

For example when I open my config file it the window will be titled =config.org ●
doom= then as soon as I make a change it will become =config.org ◉ doom=.

*** Splash screen

Emacs can render an image as the splash screen, and [[https://github.com/MarioRicalde][@MarioRicalde]] came up with a
cracker! He's also provided me with a nice Emacs-style /E/. I was using the
blackhole image, but as I've stripped down the splash screen I've switched to
just using the /E/.

I frequently want to make use of Emacs while in a terminal emulator. To make
this easier, I can construct a few handy aliases.

However, a little convenience script in =~/.local/bin= can have the same effect,
be available beyond the specific shell I plop the alias in, then also allow me
to add a few bells and whistles --- namely:
+ Accepting stdin by putting it in a temporary file and immediately opening it.
+ Guessing that the =tty= is a good idea when ~$DISPLAY~ is unset (relevant with SSH
  sessions, among other things).
+ With a whiff of 24-bit color support, sets ~TERM~ variable to a =terminfo= that
  (probably) announces 24-bit color support.
+ Changes GUI =emacsclient= instances to be non-blocking by default (~--no-wait~),
  and instead take a flag to suppress this behaviour (~-w~).

I would use =sh=, but using arrays for argument manipulation is just too
convenient, so I'll raise the requirement to =bash=. Since arrays are the only
'extra' compared to =sh=, other shells like =ksh= etc. should work too.

*** Prompt to run setup script

At various points in this config, content is conditionally tangled to
=./setup.sh=. It's no good just putting content there if it isn't run though.
To help remind me to run it when needed, let's add a little prompt when there's
anything to be run.

#+name: run-setup
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(if (file-exists-p "setup.sh")
    (if (string-empty-p (string-trim (with-temp-buffer (insert-file-contents "setup.sh") (buffer-string)) "#!/usr/bin/env bash"))
        (message ";; Setup script is empty")
      (message ";; Detected content in the setup script")
      (pp-to-string

          (defun +config-run-setup ()

                                       (propertize "Warning!" 'face '(bold warning))))
              (find-file (expand-file-name "setup.sh" doom-private-dir))

* Packages
** Loading instructions
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no
:END:

This is where you install packages, by declaring them with the ~package!~ macro in
=packages.el=, then running ~doom refresh~ on the command line.
This file shouldn't be byte compiled.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "packages.el" :comments no
;; -*- no-byte-compile: t; -*-
#+end_src

You'll then need to restart Emacs for your changes to take effect! Or at least,
run =M-x doom/reload=.

*Warning*: Don't disable core packages listed in =~/.config/emacs/core/packages.el=.
Doom requires these, and disabling them may have terrible side effects.

*** Packages in MELPA/ELPA/emacsmirror

To install ~some-package~ from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! some-package)
#+end_src

*** Packages from git repositories

To install a package directly from a particular repo, you'll need to specify
a ~:recipe~. You'll find documentation on what ~:recipe~ accepts [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format][here]]:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! another-package
  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))
#+end_src

If the package you are trying to install does not contain a ~PACKAGENAME.el~
file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
~:files~ in the ~:recipe~:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! this-package
  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))
#+end_src

*** Disabling built-in packages

If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, for whatever reason,
you can do so here with the ~:disable~ property:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :disable t)
#+end_src
You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
all the properties for ~:recipe~. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))
#+end_src

Specify a ~:branch~ to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))
#+end_src
** Convenience
*** Emacs Everywhere
Additionally, I'm going to make some personal choices that aren't made in the
Doom module.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

    (setq emacs-everywhere-frame-name (format emacs-everywhere-frame-name-format

                                               45 nil nil "…")))
    ;; need to wait till frame refresh happen before really set
    (run-with-timer 0.1 nil #'emacs-everywhere-raise-frame-1))
  (defun emacs-everywhere-raise-frame-1 ()
    (call-process "wmctrl" nil nil nil "-a" emacs-everywhere-frame-name)))
#+end_src
** Tools
*** EVIL

#+begin_quote
From the =:editor evil= module.
#+end_quote

When I want to make a substitution, I want it to be global more often than not
--- so let's make that the default.

Now, EVIL cares a fair bit about keeping compatibility with Vim's default
behaviour. I don't. There are some particular settings that I'd rather be
something else, so let's change them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! evil
  (setq evil-ex-substitute-global t     ; I like my s/../.. to by global by default
        evil-move-cursor-back nil       ; Don't move the block cursor when toggling insert mode
        evil-kill-on-visual-paste nil)) ; Don't put overwritten text in the kill ring
#+end_src

I don't use ~evil-escape-mode~, so I may as well turn it off, I've heard it
contributes a typing delay. I'm not sure it's much, but it is an extra
~pre-command-hook~ that I don't benefit from, so...
It seems that there's a dedicated package for this, so instead of just disabling
the mode on startup, let's prevent installation of the package.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! evil-escape :disable t)
#+end_src

*** Consult

#+begin_quote
From the =:completion vertico= module.

Since we're using [[Marginalia]] too, the separation between buffers and files is
already clear, and there's no need for a different face.

*** Ispell
**** Downloading dictionaries

Let's get a nice big dictionary from [[http://app.aspell.net/create][SCOWL Custom List/Dictionary Creator]] with
the following configuration
- size :: 80 (huge)
- spellings :: British(-ise) and Australian
- spelling variants level :: 0
- diacritics :: keep
- extra lists :: hacker, roman numerals

***** Hunspell

#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (file-exists-p "/usr/share/myspell/en-custom.dic") "no" "setup.sh")

Oh, and by the way, if ~company-ispell-dictionary~ is ~nil~, then
~ispell-complete-word-dict~ is used instead, which once again when ~nil~ is
~ispell-alternate-dictionary~, which at the moment maps to a plaintext version of
the above.

It seems reasonable to want to keep an eye on my personal dict, let's have it
nearby (also means that if I change the 'main' dictionary I keep my addition).

*** TRAMP

Another lovely Emacs feature, TRAMP stands for /Transparent Remote Access,
Multiple Protocol/. In brief, it's a lovely way to wander around outside your
local filesystem.

**** Prompt recognition

Unfortunately, when connecting to remote machines Tramp can be a wee pit picky
with the prompt format. Let's try to get Bash, and be a bit more permissive with
prompt recognition.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (setenv "SHELL" "/bin/bash")
  (setq tramp-shell-prompt-pattern "\\(?:^\\|\\)[^]#$%>\n]*#?[]#$%>] *\\(\\[[0-9;]*[a-zA-Z] *\\)*")) ;; default + 
#+end_src

**** Troubleshooting

In case the remote shell is misbehaving, here are some things to try

***** Zsh

There are some escape code you don't want, let's make it behave more considerately.
#+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle no
if [[ "$TERM" == "dumb" ]]; then
    unset zle_bracketed_paste
    unset zle
    PS1='$ '
    return
fi
#+end_src

**** Guix

[[https://guix.gnu.org/][Guix]] puts some binaries that TRAMP looks for in unexpected locations.
That's no problem though, we just need to help TRAMP find them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Dashboard quick actions
When using the dashboard, there are often a small number of actions I will take.
As the dashboard is it's own major mode, there is no need to suffer the tyranny
of unnecessary keystrokes --- we can simply bind common actions to a single key!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +doom-dashboard-setup-modified-keymap ()
  (setq +doom-dashboard-mode-map (make-sparse-keymap))
  (map! :map +doom-dashboard-mode-map
        :desc "Find file" :ne "f" #'find-file
        :desc "Recent files" :ne "r" #'consult-recent-file
        :desc "Config dir" :ne "C" #'doom/open-private-config
        :desc "Open config.org" :ne "c" (cmd! (find-file (expand-file-name "config.org" doom-private-dir)))
        :desc "Open dotfile" :ne "." (cmd! (doom-project-find-file "~/.dotfiles/"))
        :desc "Notes (roam)" :ne "n" #'org-roam-node-find
        :desc "Switch buffer" :ne "b" #'+vertico/switch-workspace-buffer
        :desc "Switch buffers (all)" :ne "B" #'consult-buffer
        :desc "IBuffer" :ne "i" #'ibuffer

        :desc "Set theme" :ne "t" #'consult-theme
        :desc "Quit" :ne "Q" #'save-buffers-kill-terminal
        :desc "Show keybindings" :ne "h" (cmd! (which-key-show-keymap '+doom-dashboard-mode-map))))

(add-transient-hook! #'+doom-dashboard-mode (+doom-dashboard-setup-modified-keymap))

(add-hook! 'doom-init-ui-hook :append (+doom-dashboard-setup-modified-keymap))
#+end_src

Unfortunately the show keybindings help doesn't currently work as intended, but
this is still quite nice overall.

Now that the dashboard is so convenient, I'll want to make it easier to get to.

** Window
Window rotation is nice, and can be found under =SPC w r= and =SPC w R=.
/Layout/ rotation is also nice though. Let's stash this under =SPC w SPC=, inspired
by Tmux's use of =C-b SPC= to rotate windows.

We could also do with adding the missing arrow-key variants of the window
navigation/swapping commands.
